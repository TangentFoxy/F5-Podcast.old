		<h4>refresh for music</h4>
		<p>F5 is about music. Playing a variety or limited subset of music, not really sure which.</p>
		<p>Right now, I am running a series of experimental episodes. Eventually I hope to produce good consistent regular episodes.</p>

		<h4>2014-08-08</h4>

		<h2>F5 Podcast Episode X2 - Lusine chill out speshal</h2>
		<h4>2014-07-27</h4>

		<p>I have an intro track to use across all episodes, and decided to kick off with a really nice Lusine track, which then spiraled out of control into a Lusine-focused show of just a few tracks. I feel like this episode isn't that good, but that's why they're called experimental episodes. Feedback is appreciated!</p>
